              Without a doubt, the majority of airline arrivals happen at the
              capital city airports of each state. Sydney and Melbourne airport
              have always been the main hub for international aicraft arrivals.
              These two airports have always received between 5000 and 40000
              arrivals throughout the years of 2013 and 2023. Other airports
              such as Port Hedland in SA or Newcastle in NSW, have recorded
              infrequent overseas airline arrivals over the years. Being in
              smaller cities, Port Hedland recorded 51 aircraft arrivals while
              Newcastle recorded 37 in 2019.

              While migration arrival patterns have remained fairly constant
              from 2013 to 2020, the period between 2020 and 2022 saw a drastic
              decrease in migrant arrivals into Australia. However, there has
              been a steady increase since 2021. Looking at the total number of
              migrants from 2013 to 2023 and its split into visa/citizenship
              groups, the majority of migrants hold a temporary visa. While most
              migrants hold a temporary visa, in the year 2021, the majority of
              migrant arrivals were Australian citizens. This shows the
              returning of Australian citizens during the lockdown period.
